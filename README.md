## I'm a Student, Research Assistant, & Tech Enthusiast
 

- 🔭 ***I’m currently working on*** implementing [my own version](https://github.com/Michael-Naguib/ConwaysGameOfLife) of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) 
- 🌱 ***I’m currently learning*** C++, best design practices for working with the [CUDA Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/index.html), & [Reinforcement Learning](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/02/19/a-long-peek-into-reinforcement-learning.html) & many other marvelous topics which this margin is too narrow to contain.
- 👯 ***I’m looking to collaborate on*** methods for use with intelligent multiagent systems in Repeted Negotiations and Natural Language Processing tasks.
- 🤔 ***I’m looking for help with*** efficient graphics rendering in OpenGL
- 💬 ***Ask me about Philosophy:*** Mathematics, Computers, Piano playing ... It is nice to speculate about things not necessarily concrete! 
- ⚡ ***Fun fact:*** I love XC Running 🏃, Bouldering 🧗, and Drone Racing Quadcopters ✈️
