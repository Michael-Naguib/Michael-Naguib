### Hi there, I'm Michael
If you are looking for my professional profile checkout my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-naguib1/) but I truely have a passion for working on
different code projects so many of both types are stored in my github! 

## I'm a Student, Research Assistant, & Tech Enthusiast
 

- 🔭 ***I’m currently working on*** implementing [my own version](https://github.com/Michael-Naguib/ConwaysGameOfLife) of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) 
- 🌱 ***I’m currently learning*** C++, best design practices for working with the [CUDA Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/index.html), & [Reinforcement Learning](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/02/19/a-long-peek-into-reinforcement-learning.html) & many other marvelous topics which this margin is too narrow to contain.
- 👯 ***I’m looking to collaborate on*** methods for use with intelligent multiagent systems in Repeted Negotiations and Natural Language Processing tasks.
- 🤔 ***I’m looking for help with*** efficient graphics rendering in OpenGL
- 💬 ***Ask me about Philosophy:*** Mathematics, Computers, Piano playing ... It is nice to speculate about things not necessarily concrete! 
- 📫 ***How to reach me:*** [1michael.naguib@gmail.com](mailto:1michael.naguib@gmail.com)
- ⚡ ***Fun fact:*** I love XC Running 🏃, Bouldering 🧗, and Drone Racing Quadcopters ✈️ 
- 🎯 ***2022 Goals:*** Become an expert in CUDA and the toolkits, Polish my website, Learn Guitar, & Contribute to Open Source Projects, visualize a [3D Cellular Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)

### Highlighted Projects:
- Chaotic IFS Fractal [2D](https://github.com/Michael-Naguib/Chaotic-IFS-Fractal) & [3D](https://github.com/Michael-Naguib/ChaoticIFSFractal3D): Because Fractals are cool!
- [Boid Simulation](https://github.com/Michael-Naguib/BoidsSimulation):  Ever wonder how birds flock? 
- [Project Euler](https://github.com/Michael-Naguib/ProjectEuler): how I practice pure algorithmic coding
- [Collatz Conjecture](https://github.com/Michael-Naguib/Collatz): Simple yet baffles the mind ... (is one of the [Clay Millennium Problems](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems))


### Want More ? 
- Currently I am working as a software engineer, however my resume is available via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-naguib1/) if you are curious..  Feel free to also email me at [1michael.naguib@gmail.com](mailto:1michael.naguib@gmail.com)
- Checkout my website [https://michael-naguib.github.io/](https://michael-naguib.github.io/); I plan on writing Blog Posts & Articles about coding, mathematics and other topics piquing my interest
